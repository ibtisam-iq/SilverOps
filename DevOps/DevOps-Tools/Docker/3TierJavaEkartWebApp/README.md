## About

This is a demo project for practicing Spring + Thymeleaf. The idea was to build some basic shopping cart web app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Thymeleaf**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Data REST**. 
Database is in memory **H2**.

There is a login and registration functionality included.

Users can shop for products. Each user has his own shopping cart (session functionality).
Checkout is transactional.

Folder **src/resources/** contains config files for **shopping-cart** Spring Boot application.

* **src/resources/application.properties** - main configuration file. Here it is possible to change admin username/password,
as well as change the port number.

## How to run

Go to the root folder of the application and type:

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
mvn package -DskipTests=true
```

Once the app starts, go to the web browser and visit `http://localhost:3395/home`

Admin username: **admin**

Admin password: **admin**

User username: **user**

User password: **password**
