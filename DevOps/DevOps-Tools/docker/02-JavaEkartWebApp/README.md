# Spring Boot Shopping Cart Web App

## About

This is a demo project for practicing Spring + Thymeleaf. The idea was to build some basic shopping cart web app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Thymeleaf**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Data REST**. 
Database is in memory **H2**.

There is a login and registration functionality included.

Users can shop for products. Each user has his own shopping cart (session functionality).
Checkout is transactional.

```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
mvn package -DskipTests=true
```
